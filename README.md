# Rackspace Internal Service Standards

## Mission Statement

To improve the experience of consumers of APIs exposed internally at Rackspace by providing guidance for a consistent and pragmatic RESTful design.

## Preamble

This project is a set of guidelines that internal Rackspace APIs not already governed by another set of guidelines (e.g. OpenStack) should follow for new development.

By following the guidelines, standards and recipes found here, internal services at Rackspace will reach a higher degree of consistency that reduces friction for adoption of APIs by other internal teams, that improves the ease of exposing APIs publicly, and that reduces the effort and cost associated with developing API producer and consumer applications.

### Taxonomy

The following kinds of artifacts are in-scope for this project:

#### Guidelines

A guideline is a piece of advice that may be objective or subjective but should be followed unless there is good reason not to.

#### Standards

A standard is a specific rule that can be objectively satisfied and implemented. A standard should always be implemented by services.  A standard should not be abstract, but should be specific enough that it can be verified by a machine.

#### Cookbook Recipes

A cookbook recipe is a document focused on describing a common pattern (need or problem) and our recommended solution(s) for the common pattern.

Recipes describe best practices for supporting standards and guidelines.
