# Cookbooks

Early in the development of the Rackspace Service Oriented Architecture plan, the architects of Cloud and Foundation produced a number of Cookbooks which describe in detail aspects of developing services.  These cookbooks have been transposed here to permit extending, improving, and reference to them. This page should be considered the definitive source of Rackspace Service Cookbooks.
