# Communication and Planning

This page comes largely from the Encore UI team's engagement page. It needs to include more general information.

# SMEs and Contacts

1.  Services must appoint one point of contact from the team to help answer questions and identify SMEs and UATers as needed.
2.  Services must appoint one point of contact from the team point of contact to attend all Scrum Ceremonies for dependent teams (user interfaces, dependent systems, etc.)

# Project, Story Development & Prioritization

1.  User interface stories are included in use case planning on an equal footing to other service users.

# Timelines and Deliverables

1.  Work with Encore UI Product Manager to determine placement on the Encore UI Roadmap
2.  Work with Encore UI Product Manager on any hard deadlines
3.  Build out projects in Phases
    1.  think in terms of Minimal Viable Product (MVP) and Phased approach to release
    2.  Design Service Contracts up front, but expect that the contract will evolve as the project progresses and design your code to be flexible.
